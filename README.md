## What I love now

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It is a microsite containing a curated collection of 20 objects that I currently own and love. Built with Next.js and Tailwind, the homepage is a simple gallery of 20 cards using a grid layout. Each object then has its own page for visitors who wish to know more about the story behind the object.
